# Course Tracker

## What is it?

As developers, we are always learning. With that comes a tutorial here, an online course there. Before you know it, you find trouble keeping track of what you learned and where you learned it.

I am building the Course Tracker for myself to easily log, make notes and review courses from one central location. The Course Tracker will allow you to create a new course record, review(read) courses, edit(update) the record, or delete a course record - all with a click of a button.
